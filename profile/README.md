# SNTR-Labs

SNTR-Labs is the engineering and open-source organization for **SNTR Corp (Systems, Networks, Trust, and Resilience)**.
We build practical infrastructure software for deploying, operating, and securing compute in constrained environments.

## What you’ll find here

- **Infrastructure automation**: provisioning, lifecycle management, and configuration at scale  
- **Hardware management**: vendor-agnostic control planes and integrations (IPMI, Redfish, OOB)  
- **Edge/HPC enablement**: patterns, reference implementations, and tooling for ruggedized deployments  
- **Security and compliance**: secure-by-default configuration, auditability, and operational hardening

## Current focus areas

- **Bare-metal management**: streamlined provisioning and fleet operations for mixed hardware
- **Unified management plane**: consistent workflows across IPMI/Redfish and common vendor implementations
- **Composable building blocks**: small tools that are easy to adopt, extend, and operate

## Repositories

Pinned repositories represent active work and recommended starting points.  
If you are new here, start with the most recently updated pinned repo.

## How we work

- **Production mindset**: clear interfaces, sane defaults, and operational docs
- **Modular design**: composable components over monoliths
- **Automation-first**: repeatability across dev, lab, and production environments

## Contributing

We welcome issues and pull requests.

- Use GitHub Issues for bugs, feature requests, and design discussions
- Keep PRs focused; include testing notes and a short rationale
- Follow each repository’s `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` when present

If you’re proposing a larger change, open an issue first so we can align on scope.

## Security

If you discover a security issue, please do **not** open a public issue.  
Email the maintainers or use the repository’s security reporting mechanism if enabled.

## License

Each repository defines its own license. If a repo does not yet include a license file, it is not licensed for reuse.
